Yet to define some goals
Build a few apps,
  one UI App
  one backend App
Commit to github every day
What to do if i miss a day? - how to avoid it?

Missed days: 5 days so far in 2025
1/10, 1/11, 1/18, 1/21  - Jan 4 days
2/5        - Feb 1 day

set monthly target - good till feb end, then find another target for march onwards, try to publish an article every week on a sunday!
By Feb 20 - present the DND Game POC demo, otherwise put it in backlog.
No need of fancy website design, just anything that works is good enough. 
Later, once the POC is ready, then send it to someone else to build on top and make it a product.
nps as another idea too- maybe a POC?
