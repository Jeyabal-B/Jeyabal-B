Yet to define some goals
Build a few apps,
  one UI App
  one backend App
Commit to github every day
What to do if i miss a day? - how to avoid it?
Missed days:
1/10, 1/11, 1/18, 1/21
set monthly target
By Feb 20 - present the DND Game POC demo, otherwise drop it
No need of fancy website design, just anything that works is good enough. 
Later, once the POC is ready, then send it to someone else to build on top and make it a product.
